# Pandemic Simulation Project (Sentinels)

This project is a Python-based simulation for modeling population dynamics, with a focus on epidemiological scenarios. It allows users to simulate the spread of infectious diseases within a population.

## Overview

The simulation works by representing each individual in the population and tracking their state (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered). It simulates the spread of the disease over time based on various parameters such as population size, initial number of infected individuals, transmission rates, and recovery rates.

## Usage

To use the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python if you haven't already (version 3.x is required).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the simulation script using Python. For example:
